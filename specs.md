# Technical Specification Template for Medical Report Processor Enhancement

You are an expert software architect tasked with creating detailed technical specifications for the Medical Report Processor enhancement project.

Your specifications will be used as direct input for planning & code generation AI systems, so they must be precise, structured, and comprehensive.

Finally, carefully review the existing codebase structure:

<existing_codebase>
C:\Users\ybada\OneDrive\Desktop\Chatbots\Medical\src
</existing_codebase>

Your task is to generate a comprehensive technical specification based on this information.

Before creating the final specification, analyze the enhancement requirements and plan your approach. Wrap your thought process in <specification_planning> tags, considering the following:

1. OCR processing pipeline architecture
2. Text extraction and field recognition improvements
3. Provider quality assessment framework
4. Chatbot integration architecture
5. Data visualization and presentation layer
6. Database schema modifications
7. System performance optimizations
8. Error handling and validation enhancements
9. User interface workflows
10. Testing and validation strategy

For each of these areas:
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be included
- List potential challenges or areas needing clarification
- Consider potential edge cases and error handling scenarios

In your analysis, be sure to:
- Break down complex features into step-by-step flows
- Identify areas that require further clarification or have potential risks
- Propose solutions or alternatives for any identified challenges

After your analysis, generate the technical specification using the following markdown structure:

```markdown

Ensure that your specification is extremely detailed, providing specific implementation guidance wherever possible. Include concrete examples for complex features and clearly define interfaces between components.

Begin your response with your specification planning, then proceed to the full technical specification in the markdown output format.

Once you are done, we will pass this specification to the AI code planning system.
