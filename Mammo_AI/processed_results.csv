patient telephone number: (418)456-6773
breast assessment-bilateral mammogram and right breast/axilla
ultrasound
clinical indication:
hbb y/of. lesion noted under right breast since 2015-16; waxes and
wanes in size; wonders about ripple an implant? nontender and mobile.
comparison:
none.
findings:
at the time of imaging, patient notes intermittent lump/ripple 6-7
o’clock right breast, can not feel today.
breast density: scattered areas of fibroglandular density (25-50%
fibroglandular tissue).
bilateral mammogram performed including implant displaced views. no
concerning breast mass, architectural toreion or calcification. no
mammographic abnormality in the region of clinical concern (inferior
right breast). follow-up ultrasound the region of clinical concern
demonstrates no concerning abnormality. in the region patient
indicates, there is slight focal undulation/ripple (2-3 mm) of the
implant contour, potentially this could be the palpable abnormality.
entire breast ultrasound demonstrates no sonographic features of
implant rupture.
on mammogram in the right axilla incidental note is made of a region
of localized coarse calcifications spanning 2.2 x 1.6 cm. targeted
ultrasound demonstrates thie probably corresponds to a 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.5
em lymph node with thin cortex and echogenic foci more positioned
towards the hilum, in keeping with lymph node calcification. overall
appearance is favored benign. this could reflect sequela of prior
remote nonspecific granulomatous disease, potentially related to prior
tattooing (right arm tattoo noted), and it is difficult to exclude the
poesibility of silicone accumulation due to occult gel bleed type
implant leak (although this would not be typical ultrasound appearance
