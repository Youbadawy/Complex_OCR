# Request for Medical Report Processor Enhancements

I have a Medical Report Processor application that needs enhancement. Here's my current project:

IDEA: A complex OCR tool that transfers mammography reports into a structured format (CSV), analyzes the data, and provides an interactive interface with LLM capabilities for data exploration and insights.

I'm looking to collaborate with you to turn this into a detailed enhancement plan. Let's iterate together until we have a complete request that addresses all improvement areas.

After each of our exchanges, please return the current state of the request in this format:

# Medical Report Processor Enhancement Project
## Project Description
[Description of the current system and enhancement goals]

## Target Users

## Enhancement Areas
### [Enhancement Category]

## Technical Specifications
- [ ] [Technical requirement]
    - [ ] [Technical detail]

## Success Metrics

## Timeline and Priorities

Please:

    Ask me questions about any areas that need more clarification
    Suggest improvements or considerations I might have missed
    Help me organize requirements logically
    Show me the current state of the spec after each exchange
    Flag any potential technical challenges or important implementation decisions

We'll continue iterating and refining the request until we have a comprehensive enhancement plan ready for implementation.
